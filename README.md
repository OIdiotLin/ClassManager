#ClassManager

##Well, it's an app used for managing stuffs in class such as randomizing, events record, address book, releasing notices, etc..

<p>Actually, it's an attempt for me to write C/S. During the development, I'll be aware of PHP, Android and communication between them. Hope some of my classmates would help develop/maintain this.</p>
